## Presentation

ANAIS is a mod for SFS (Spaceflight Simulator) that replaces the game navigation system with a much more elaborated one.

Trajectories in space are hard to predict. Whether you aim for another planet or another craft, it's hard to figure a trajectory that leads you to your target without wasting tons of fuel. ANAIS automatically calculates the most efficient trajectory for you and tells you how to perform your burn maneuvers.

ANAIS is suited for beginners to help them with basic maneuvers, but also provides a whole panel of options for experienced players to help them setting up complex trajectories involving advanced maneuvers like gravity assist.

## How does it work?

The most common use is the following:
Ingame, select any object as a target, and click "Navigate to". ANAIS instantly calculates a transfer for you to get an encounter with that object.

Then switch to the world view, and ANAIS will tell you how to burn to set your craft onto a transfer trajectory. Just let ANAIS guide you.

When time-warping, you'll notice that your craft will come to an encounter with the target. ANAIS will then show you a countdown to let you know that the encounter is imminent.
In the world view, ANAIS will assist you to handle the final approach and the docking procedure. 

ANAIS can calculate transfers in many configurations: you can travel to a moon, to another planet, return to the mother planet after you visited a moon...
ANAIS has been thought for beginners, but for the best pilots, ANAIS also provides some options to help them to plan complex trajectories involving advanced maneuvers like gravity assist.

## How to install it?

## External contributions

ANAIS uses a Lambert solver that was worked out following the procedure described [here](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/MAD/pub/ACT-RPR-MAD-2014-RevisitingLambertProblem.pdf) by Dario Izzo. I want to thank him, his work proved to be invaluable to make this mod possible.
Thanks to the SFS modding community that helped me on several occasions to solve issues related to Unity, the game engine.
